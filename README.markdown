Python utilities
======================

PySide/PyQt

* qt_compat.py - Centralize the differences between PySide and PyQt
* qore_utils.py - Qt helpers that only depend on QtCore, including threading, models, QObject tools
* qui_utils.py - Qt helpers that depend on QtGui, including standardized error reporting mechanism, HTML Delegate, a QMainWindow that provides more signals Qt-Maemo5 graceful degredation
* qml_utils.py - I am still learning QML so these are still being defined
* qtpie.py - QWidget-based pie menus (See QWidget version of ejpi for an example)
* qtpieboard.py - QtPie keyboard (See QWidget version of ejpi for an example)
* qwrappers.py - Default implementation of objects owning QApplication and QMainWindow objects

PyGTK / Hildon Development:

* go_utils.py - Threading, API version compat, etc
* gtk_utils.py
* hildonize.py - Gracefully fallback when Hildon features are unavailable
* tp_utils - Telepathy tools

Other

* linux.py - XDG Helpers

Everything else is misc tools that fill in gaps for Python.  I don't really end up using them except for misc.log_exception I place around every single slot so to ease debugging users' applications.

Usage
======================
Copy what files you need into your tool

As you can tell by my skeleton project (https://github.com/epage/MaemoPythonSkeleton) I copy the whole folder to make it easier to diff between projects to make sure everything is up to date.

Why no installer?  These are subject to change and I don't want to break people

The LICENSE is LGPL v2.1 but I am willing to negotiate on that.
